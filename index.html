Games without electricity are triumphant, both children and adults are eager to reach for them. We like good, proven solutions thanks to which we can spend family time and at the same time very creatively. A great example of such an option is UNO gameplay. Well, but what exactly is this game about?
</p><p>
</p><p>First, a bit of history. It turns out that UNO has already had several decades of tradition behind it, for the first time the world came across this proposal in 1971. And immediately the advantages of the game were appreciated, which began to gain popularity with wildfire. Currently, it is sold around the world by the widely known brand Mattel.
</p><p>
</p><p>To play UNO, we need a special colored deck of cards (we will not play with a normal deck). The rules could be compared to those of the Macao game. How many people can fight in this case? A minimum of two people, a maximum of eight can sit at a table. And what about cards, what is worth knowing about them? Some of them are marked with numbers, while others have to be classified as functionals.</p></div>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7"><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>You must first shuffle the cards. Then put the first number card on the table. It is she who will start our game. Each player receives 7 cards, which he arranges like a fan. The gameplay consists in matching one of his cards in terms of color, shape or symbol to the face up. If we do not have one, we are left to draw another card.
</div><div>
</div><div>There are also special cards here. For example, when we draw Take two, it means that the next player must take two cards. When a stop is involved, the next player loses his turn. There are several types of these types of cards that make the game much more dynamic and unpredictable, because we never know what our predecessor will draw and what will treat us.
</div><div>
</div><div>And where did the name of the game come from? When a player realizes that he has only one card in his hand, he must shout UNO quickly! (i.e. one). The winner is the person who gets rid of the cards. What do all players strive for? Their goal is to get 500 points, taking into account the basic version of the game. It's good to know that there are many more versions, there are various variations and changes thanks to which this game based on the executioner deck never gets bored.
</div><div>
</div><div>You can take it with you anywhere, it won't take a lot of space in your backpack or suitcase. We will spread out the cards wherever we feel like it.
</div><div>
</div><div>Mattel has prepared a lot of propositions for this title for fans of card games, besides the classic one, for example, the cards have been additionally enriched with fabulously colorful characters. Certainly, such a UNO option will appeal to all kids!<br>Read more about drunk Uno here: <a href="https://www.ringoffirerules.com/drunk-uno-game-rules/">https://www.ringoffirerules.com/drunk-uno-game-rules/</a></div></h3>
